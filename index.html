                This analysis uses the Street Light Retrofits 2014 dataset from Boston's open data portal. The dataset tracks 9,789 street lights that the city converted to LEDs in 2014, replacing older Sodium and Mercury vapor lamps. For each light, we have the technical details (how much power it used before and after), where it's located, how much money the city saves annually, and when the work was done.

                That said, this data has some important limitations. The most obvious is that we're only looking at lights that actually got converted - we don't know anything about lights that were skipped or postponed, which could tell us something about why certain areas were prioritized over others. Speaking of priorities, we also don't know if some neighborhoods got upgraded first for reasons that aren't in the data (maybe political pressure, available funding, or just easier infrastructure). The cost savings assume electricity rates stayed constant throughout the year, which probably isn't quite right. And finally, while we can measure energy savings down to the watt, we have no idea whether people actually like these new lights or if they're brighter, dimmer, or a different color than what was there before.
